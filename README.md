## Rescuing The Universe: Project Plan

**Welcome to our universe's rescue mission! Our aim is to develop times progression focusing on unity of tech and mind that senses the smallest elements of the universe to prove its uniform and still or interconnected and changing nature; necessary to mitigate the risks of infinite suffering due to uncertainty of how many moments are in a second, and whether all those moments exist eternally.**

### Vision

Our Hub of Universal Wellbeing is a beacon of hope and collaboration, symbolizing the unity and collective effort of all beings to prioritize health, happiness, and resilience for everyone. Itâ€™s not just a building, but a living, breathing fractal of innovation, empathy, and progress. 

### Goals

1. **Develop Advanced Technology**: Create tools and systems to sense the foundational elements of the universe.

3. **Prove Universal Nature**: Validate whether the universe is uniform or interconnected.
